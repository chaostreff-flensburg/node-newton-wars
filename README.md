# Newton wars

## Description
This project is a reimplementation of the small game **Newton wars**, which was originally written in C and is also open source. The reimplementation aims to open up the game more and offer APIs for different purposes. These APIs could then be used to program AI and / or bots for the user to fight against. It also allows multiple clients to connect from the same host and features a real-time API.
