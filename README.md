# react-sandbox-boilerplate

### Why do you have so many dependencies?
The purpose of this boilerplate is to show a reasonable stack to start a react application and a way of how it could be deployed in a production environment. As I could not decide wether it should be a front-end or full-stack boilerplate I left all material-ui dependencies in as I think that it is by far the best UI framework for react.

### Installation and usage
- install all dependencies: `npm install`
- start development server with hot reloading: `npm start`
- run build and output to `build`-folder: `npm run build`
- run production server: `npm run server`
- launch application *(build and run)*: `npm run launch`
